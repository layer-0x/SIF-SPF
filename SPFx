## Sentence Summary

This SPF requests 5M DAI for establishing a Self Insurance Fund (SIF) for MakerDAO.

## Paragraph Summary

The SIF will reimburse legal expenses incurred by specific participants in the MakerDAO ecosystem in case of legal or regulatory proceedings. 

It will initially provide coverage to the founding team, recognized delegates and permanent contributors. Coverage can be extended to additional group of persons in the future.


## Motivation

Self-insurance is a well known risk management technique that consists in setting funds aside for compensating a possible future loss. More technically, it is a tool for retaining risk managing risks professionally. Typically self insurance is used when risk can not be transferred through instruments like insurances. Self insurance instruments can be used as an alternative or a complement to traditional insurances. 

Self insurances are fully customizable instruments which can be tailor made to cover novel or complex risks. For these reason, they are suitable risk management instruments for DAOs.

## Special Purpose Fund Name

Self Insurance Fund

## Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials

DAOs are novel organizational structures and as such, expose their participants to unprecedented legal risks. MakerDAO is not a company and is not incorporated as a legal entity, hence it is unable to provide liability protection for its stakeholders. Traditional risk transfer instruments such as insurances are scarce in the crypto industy. The SIF aims to fill this gap, retaining and managing some of these legal risks. 

The SIF will be used as a contingency budget to cover legal defense costs in case a MakerDAO stakeholder is target of a lawsuit or a regulatory action. Additionally, the SIF can be used in the future as a first protection layer for getting additional coverage in the insurance or financial markets.

Funds will be held in escrow. If a legitimate claim occurres, Comptrollers will release funds to a whitelisted ETH address controlled by the claimant. Claims have to be backed by sufficient documentation and will follow a process determined in the SIF feasibility study. Claims will be first submitted to an external, techncial committee, which will analyze the claim and the documentation and issue a recommendation for approving the claim or not. The Comptrollers will act de facto as an internal committee who can decide to accept the recommendation and release the funds or deny it. 

The companies [Gallagher] (https://www.ajg.com/us/) and [Artex] (https://www.artexrisk.com/) have developed for SES a [feasibility study] (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1zH6ycmrpAzWmdcl9Zlx6mB-VNMg3AV5I) including description of the risk coverage, capital requirements and claims protocol.

* The Special Purpose Fund (SPF) Scope must outline the scope of the problem SPF is filling, its solution, and any dependencies and maintenance necessary for the SPF to contribute to the success of the project.
* The Special Purpose Fund Scope should be specific to ensure that Maker Governance has clarity about what need it is supporting.
* The Special Purpose Fund Scope must be limited to either timeframe or specific deliverable (i.e., The Protocol needs audits. Funds are approved, Dai goes into escrow, and 2 Comptrollers release funds once audits are complete).

### Funding Breakdown

Funds in the SIF are intended to be held in escrow as a contingency budget for covering legal expenses. 

A comprehensive claim and operational protocol will be developed, which will include: 

- Description of insured persons
- Description of the risks covered
- Coverage Amounts
- Exclusions
- Claim process
 -Documentation required


Additionally, the SIF will be used as a first protection layer to get additional coverage in the insurance and financial markets. 
If the SIF SPF is approved, we will make as next step an approximation to insurance markets in London to test apetite of the market and conditions for extended legal defense coverage and d&o.




* Outline key milestones that exemplify a SPF funding to be completed.
* The funding breakdown should outline the requested funds in detail, including the total amount.
