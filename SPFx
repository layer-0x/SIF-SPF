## Sentence Summary

This SPF requests 5M DAI for establishing a Self Insurance Fund (SIF) for MakerDAO.

## Paragraph Summary

The SIF will be initially used to reimburse legal defense expenses in case of a legal or regulatory action against certain participants of the Maker Ecosystem.

Initially, coverage will be provided to:

- Founding team
- Recognized delegates
- CU Facilitators 
- CU permanent contributors

Coverage may be extended in the future to cover additional groups of persons.


## Motivation

Self-insurance is a well-known risk management technique that consists in setting funds aside for compensating a possible future loss. Technically, it is a tool for retaining and managing risks professionally. Typically self-insurance is used when risk can not be transferred through instruments like insurances. Self-insurance instruments can be used as an alternative or a complement to a traditional insurance. 

DAOs are novel organizational structures and as such, may expose their participants to novel legal risks. MakerDAO is not a company, is not incorporated as a legal entity and has no employees. For these reasons it is unable to limit liability risks for its stakeholders, the way a centralized organization could do for its employees. 

Self-insurances are customizable instruments which can be tailor-made to manage novel or complex risks. They are for this reaon suitable risk management instruments for DAOs.

## Special Purpose Fund Name

Self Insurance Fund

## Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials


The SIF will be used as a contingency budget to cover legal defense costs in case a MakerDAO stakeholder is a target of a lawsuit or a regulatory action. 

All claims will be processeed according to a strict process contained in the SIF Claim Procedure Manual. This Procedure Manual will be developed by the companies Gallagher and Artex

MakerDAO stakeholders entitled to receive coverage will be defined in the claim protocol and previously whitelisted. One of the requisites for a claim to be valid is a direct link between the legal proceedings and the activity of the person at MakerDAO. In principle any type of process is eligible for coverage, but cases such as fraud or conflict of interest will be excluded from coverage. Claims will be submitted initially to an external, technical committee, that will assess the claim and produce a payout recommendation. SPF Multisig signers can decide if they execute the payout to the claimant or not.  

Funds will be held in escrow. If a legitimate claim occurs, Comptrollers will release funds to a whitelisted ETH address controlled by the claimant. Claims have to be backed by sufficient documentation and will follow a process determined in the SIF feasibility study. Claims will be first submitted to an external, technical committee, which will analyze the claim and the supportive documentation and issue a recommendation for approving or rejecting the claim. The Comptrollers will act de facto as an internal committee that can decide to accept or reject the recommendation of the technical committe, and ultimately decide to release the funds to the claimant. 

The companies [Gallagher] (https://www.ajg.com/us/) and [Artex] (https://www.artexrisk.com/) have developed for SES a [feasibility study] (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1zH6ycmrpAzWmdcl9Zlx6mB-VNMg3AV5I) including a description of the risk coverage, capital requirements, and claims protocol.

### Funding Breakdown

- Funding will be done in a lump sum upon Governance Approval of the SPF.
- Funds in the SIF are intended to be held as a contingency budget for covering legal defense and legal representation expenses. 
- The SIF will not cover operational costs of the project.

Coverage amounts and limits per case will depend on:
a) Risk layer of the claimant
b) Type of process
c) Number of processess per year
d) Number of targeted persons per process



A detailed claim protocol will be developed, which will include: 

- Description of insured persons and classification in risk layers
- Registration process
- Description of the risks covered
- Coverage amounts and limits
- Exclusions
- Description of the claim process, timimg and decision making rules
- Documentation required for claims


In the next stage of the project, the SIF will be used as a first protection layer to get additional coverage in the insurance and financial markets. 

If the SIF SPF is approved, next milestones of the project are:

 - An approximation to insurance markets in London to test appetite of the market for underwriting legal risks and negotiate conditions.
 - Hire the technical committe which will be in charge of the initial claim evaluation and assessment.
 - If necessary, and depending on the response of the markets, structure a legal vehicle to act as an insurance policyholder.
 - Evaluate integration with decentralized insurance protocols and permissionless claim management solutions.
