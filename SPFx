## Sentence Summary

This SPF requests 5M DAI for establishing a Self Insurance Fund (SIF) for MakerDAO.

## Paragraph Summary

The SIF will reimburse legal expenses incurred by specific participants in the MakerDAO ecosystem in case of legal or regulatory proceedings. 

It will initially provide coverage to the founding team, recognized delegates, and permanent contributors. Coverage will be extended to additional groups of persons.


## Motivation

Self-insurance is a well-known risk management technique that consists in setting funds aside for compensating a possible future loss. More technically, it is a tool for retaining and managing risks professionally. Typically self-insurance is used when risk can not be transferred through instruments like insurance. Self-insurance instruments can be used as an alternative or a complement to a traditional insurance. 

Self-insurances are fully customizable instruments which can be tailor-made to cover novel or complex risks. For these reason, they are suitable risk management instruments for DAOs.

## Special Purpose Fund Name

Self Insurance Fund

## Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials

DAOs are novel organizational structures and as such, expose their participants to unprecedented legal risks. MakerDAO is not a company and is not incorporated as a legal entity, hence it is unable to provide liability protection for its stakeholders. Traditional risk transfer instruments such as insurance are scarce in the crypto industry. The SIF aims to fill this gap, retaining and managing some of these legal risks. 

The SIF will be used as a contingency budget to cover legal defense costs in case a MakerDAO stakeholder is a target of a lawsuit or a regulatory action. MakerDAO stakeholders entitled to receive coverage will be defined in the claim protocol and previously whitelisted. There needs to be a direct link between the legal proceedings and the activity of the person at MakerDAO. In principle any type of process is eligible for coverage, but cases such as fraud or conflict of interest will be excluded. 

Additionally, the SIF can be used in the future as a first protection layer for getting additional coverage in the insurance or financial markets.

Funds will be held in escrow. If a legitimate claim occurs, Comptrollers will release funds to a whitelisted ETH address controlled by the claimant. Claims have to be backed by sufficient documentation and will follow a process determined in the SIF feasibility study. Claims will be first submitted to an external, technical committee, which will analyze the claim and the supportive documentation and issue a recommendation for approving or rejecting the claim. The Comptrollers will act de facto as an internal committee that can decide to accept or reject the recommendation of the technical committe, and ultimately decide to release the funds to the claimant. 

The companies [Gallagher] (https://www.ajg.com/us/) and [Artex] (https://www.artexrisk.com/) have developed for SES a [feasibility study] (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1zH6ycmrpAzWmdcl9Zlx6mB-VNMg3AV5I) including a description of the risk coverage, capital requirements, and claims protocol.

### Funding Breakdown

Funds in the SIF are intended to be held in escrow as a contingency budget for covering legal defense and legal representation expenses. Coverage amounts and limits per case will depend on:
a) Risk layer of the claimant
b) Type of process
c) Number of processess per year
d) Number of targeted persons per process

The SIF will not cover operational costs of the project.

A detailed claim protocol will be developed, which will include: 

- Description of insured persons and classification in risk layers
- Registration process
- Description of the risks covered
- Coverage amounts and limits
- Exclusions
- Description of the claim process, timimg and decision making rules
- Documentation required for claims


In the next stage of the project, the SIF will be used as a first protection layer to get additional coverage in the insurance and financial markets. 

If the SIF SPF is approved, next milestones of the project are:
 - An approximation to insurance markets in London to test appetite of the market for underwriting legal risks and negotiate conditions for extended legal defense coverage and d&o.
 - Hire the technical committe which will be in charge of the initial claim evaluation and assessment.
 - If necessary, and depending on the response of the markets, structure a legal vehicle to act as an insurance policyholder.
 - Evaluate integration with decentralized insurance protocols and permissionless claim management solutions.
