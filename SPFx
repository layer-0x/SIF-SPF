## Sentence Summary

This SPF requests 5M DAI for establishing a Self Insurance Fund (SIF) for MakerDAO.

## Paragraph Summary

The SIF will reimburse legal expenses incurred by specific participants in the MakerDAO ecosystem in case of legal or regulatory proceedings. 

It will initially provide coverage to the founding team, recognized delegates and permanent contributors. Coverage can be extended to additional group of persons in the future.


## Motivation

Self-insurance is a well known risk management technique that consists in setting funds aside for compensating a possible future loss. More technically, it is a tool for retaining risk managing risks professionally. Typically self insurance is used when risk can not be transferred through instruments like insurances. Self insurance instruments can be used as an alternative or a complement to traditional insurances. 

Self insurances are fully customizable instruments which can be tailor made to cover novel or complex risks. For these reason, they are suitable risk management instruments for DAOs.

## Special Purpose Fund Name

Self Insurance Fund

## Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials

DAOs are novel organizational structures and as such, expose their participants to unprecedented legal risks. MakerDAO is not a company and is not incorporated as a legal entity, hence it is uncapable to provide liability protection for its stakeholders. Traditional risk transfer instruments such as insurances are scarce in the crypto industries. The SIF aims to fill this gap and coverarge to some of these novel risks. 
The SIF aims to provide coverage

The SIF will be used as a contingency budget to cover legal defense costs in case a MakerDAO stakeholder is target of a lawsuit or a regulatory action. Additionally, the SIF can be used in the future as a first protection layer for getting additional coverage in the insurance or financial markets.

Funds will be held in escrow. If a legitimate claim occurres, Comptrollers will release funds to a whitelisted ETH address controlled by the claimant. Claims have to be backed by sufficient documentation and will follow a process determined in the SIF feasibility study.



The companies Gallagher / Artex have developed for SES a feasibility study including description of the risk coverage, capital requirements and claims protocol.

* The Special Purpose Fund Scope should be specific to ensure that Maker Governance has clarity about what need it is supporting.
* The Special Purpose Fund Scope must be limited to either timeframe or specific deliverable (i.e., The Protocol needs audits. Funds are approved, Dai goes into escrow, and 2 Comptrollers release funds once audits are complete).
